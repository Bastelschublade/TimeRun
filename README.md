# TimeRun

TimeRun is a SideScroller based platform game. You keep running all the time and your only chance to survive a level is jumping and sliding in time. To master a level you have to collect every single coin. This way you are able to unlock new levels and skins for your charakter.

This Game is developed in LibGDX (Java) for learning und tutorial pupose. It's optimized for Android touch devices but the LibGDX framework still offers builds for other platforms like windows/linux or browser. iOS and Windowsphone is not supported nativly but available through the web version.

The tutorial I created is in german only but if you are intrested in an english version just let me know.
